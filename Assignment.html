Survive University</I></u></font></h1>
<p> So, you're going to University? Good for you! You survived and thrived in high school despite a global pandemic shutting you out! Don't underestimate yourself! Don't let the campus intimidate you! Explore it, look around, you never know what might lead you to your dream job! And remember, you made it this far, you can go further! 

Below you will find few tips for your time at University. Hopefully you can adopt them before everything gets out of hand. University  is a difficult place no doubt but its even more difficult if you don't believe in yourself. </p>
<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"><font><font face="Comic Sans MS"; style="position:relative; top: 10px; left: 0px;"> <li>A person is judged by the company he keeps </li> </font></h3>

<p><font color="#009933"; font-size:12px> When at campus or class try to find engaging companions who can broaden your knowledge and add to your wisdom. Choose companions who help you study rather than 
friends who make it difficult to study and stay away from friends who make fun of you. Friends are supposed to help you, be there for you when nobody is, they should be the ones you feel comfortable with not the onese who are too cool to care for you, not the ones who make you uncomfortable.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"><font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <ul> <li>  Do your coursework. </li> </ul></font></h3>

<p><font color="#4d0099">Doing your coursework will not only get you a better grade in the class, but it will help you understand the 
material. Do the easy work first so you can get some of those things of that list Do not procrastinate; it will get you nowhere.
Use dead time like bus rides or while you are eating breakfast to catch up on assigned reading.

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><ul><li>Study</li></ul></font></h3>

<p id="font"> Tests and quizzes will make up a large part of your grade, so remember to study as often as you can. 
Set out a time to study at least a week in advance when you know you have a big test coming up, so you have lots of time to understand the material. 
This will also help you see if you have any trouble with the material so you can ask your teachers any questions well in advance.
Be attentive during class. The more you understand the material, the easier it will be to study.
Take detailed notes during class. Make sure you write them in your own words so you are really absorbing the material. They will be a great point
 of reference before your exams. However, try not to take overly detailed notes,writing every little thing down will only make it harder to study 
and remember the material.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><ul><li>Try to always be on time</li></ul></font></h3>

<p><font color="#4d0099">Teachers adore students who are on time and always keep them on their good sides. Making an effort to be on 
time shows you are enthusiastic and teachers notice this behavior. You might even consider showing up early for class.
If you get to choose seats, do not be afraid to sit up front; students in the front rows can focus better. The best place to sit is in the second row next
 to the side if you can, because you can pay attention to the teacher and still be sociable with friends. Teachers also tend to look into the center of 
the room and they recognize attentive students.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><ul><li>Stay focused.</li></ul></font></h3>

<p id="font"> To succeed in high school, you have to have the right mind frame. Even if you are not feeling motivated
on a particular day, tell yourself to work hard and know that you will reap the benefits later. Do not let friends lead you off the path that leads 
to success. Avoid giggling with your friends or texting during class, and work on listening to everything your teacher says.
While your teacher is teaching, keep quiet, unless he or she is asking for answers. If your friends want to talk to you in class, ask them to wait 
until later. Do not be rude to your teachers or your grade will go down.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left" class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><ul><li>Keep your grades up.</li></ul></font></h3>
<p><font color="#4d0099">Though you should always make time for fun, you should focus on keeping up your grades. Work hard on your
homework, your test grades, your projects, and your participation grades, and your final grades will skyrocket. Set goals at the beginning of every 
marking period and try to surpass them.
Remember to maintain your own standards. Though getting straight A's may be easy for your best friend, if it's very tough for you to maintain B's, 
just focus on improving and doing the best you can.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><ul><li>Have a great planner.</li></ul></font></h3>

<p id="font"> Have a plan of what you are going to study. Do not forget to have breaks, fun outings, 
and after-school plans into your planner. Do not forget to bring it to every class so you can always keep it up-to-date.
Carefully mark all of your exams in your planner. Carve out time to study for each exam.
Mark times when you will be busy with friends or social events, so you know what to expect in advance.</font></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left"; class="design"> <font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <ul><li>Keep your binders organized.</li></ul></font></h3>

<p><font color="#4d0099">You don't want to be late to class because you couldn't find your textbook! You should have a separate binder
 for each class, and it should be
clearly marked so you know which one to bring to each of your classes.Your should have separaters for each unit so you don't spend half the class looking 
for stuff.</font></p>

<p id="font"> It is important to make being healthy part of your every day routine. Though you may feel that your schedule is 
too-jam packed to pay attention to your body, 
remember that if you feel healthy and are being active, you will improve your appearance and performance in school.Remember if you don't take care of your 
body today, your body will not help you tomorrow.
